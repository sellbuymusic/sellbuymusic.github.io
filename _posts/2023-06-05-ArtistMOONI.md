<p><strong>Q1. Please introduce yourself. What genre of music do you mainly create?</strong></p>
<p>A1. Hello, I&#39;m composer Kim Moon-jeong, who wants to create warm music. ðŸ˜Š I mainly focus on composing music for short films, and personally, I enjoy creating orchestral and piano pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q2. How did you come to know about SELLBUYMUSIC?</strong></p>
<p>A2. While I was doing YouTube for a long time, I used to create music to include in my videos. I received a recommendation from acquaintances that SELLBUYMUSIC is a great site to sell my music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q3. If there are any artists or songs that inspire you, who are they or what songs are they?</strong></p>
<p>A3. I still frequently listen to the La La Land soundtrack. Just by enjoying the music, it stimulates my imagination to the point where I can envision scenes from the movie. I have a song called &quot;MOON LAND,&quot; which I created by capturing the feeling of visiting a amusement park in Dangjin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q4. If there is a particular aspect that you pay the most attention to when creating music, what would it be?</strong></p> 
<p>A4. I believe that creating one song with musicality and persuasiveness is more important than making many songs. Personally, as a composer with a lot of things to express, I can create multiple works in a short period of time. However, after organizing and reviewing them, I realized that there weren&#39;t many songs worth using. I strive to maintain musicality and persuasiveness because I want to create more songs that are worth using. ðŸ˜„</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q5. If there is a favorite song among the music you have created, what song is it?</strong></p></p> 
<p>A5. I love the song titled &quot;The Time I Think of You&quot; the most. This song was an attempt to express my feelings of uncertainty through music. Although it&#39;s not perfect yet, it&#39;s a song that brings back the emotions of that time when I listen to it personally.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q6. Please personally introduce the appealing points of your music to the readers.</strong></p> 
<p>A6. People who like my music often say that it feels warm. Personally, since it&#39;s my own music, I don&#39;t always feel that way... However, I occasionally feel proud of creating warm music. ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p><strong>Q7. Are there any moments in your daily life that provide musical inspiration? If so, when?</strong></p> 
<p>A7. There are moments when my heart is moved. It could be when I see something beautiful or cute, when I listen to a good song, or when I watch an emotional movie or drama. Those moments accumulate and lead me to a state where I can create music. However, the greatest inspiration came from experiencing the emotion of love from people, and it had a more impactful effect. ðŸ¥°</p>
<p><strong>Q8. What kind of artist would you like to be known as in the world?</strong></p> 
<p>A8. I want to be known as an artist who creates warm music. When people want their hearts to be warmed, they can listen to &#39;MOONI&#39;s music. I want to create music that naturally warms the heart when people listen to it. ^^</p>
