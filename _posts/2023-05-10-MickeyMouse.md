<p>Hi, everyone here.</p>
<p>This is the Royalty Free Stock Music Library, Sellbuymusic.</p>
<p><strong>Today, I want to talk about the exclusive copyright of Walt Disney&#39;s Mickey Mouse, which is famous worldwide.</strong></p>
<p>1928 was the year when Mickey Mouse was born. He has become a symbol of the Walt Disney Company, even though he is now 95 years old.</p>

<p><strong>Q1. What is copyright?</strong></p>
<p>A1. Copyright is the exclusive right that authors or their successors in title have to use or authorize the use of their literary, artistic, or scientific works.</p>
<p><strong>Q2. What type of copyright does Mickey Mouse have?</strong></p>
<p>A2. Property right of copyright (the right of the author to economically benefit by allowing themselves or others to use the work).</p>

<p>The US Copyright Law was first introduced in 1790, with a protection period of up to 28 years. However, following two revisions of the US Copyright Law, the protection period was extended to 56 years, with each period being 28 years long. Originally, Mickey Mouse&#39;s copyright should have expired in 1984, but with the 1976 revision of the law, he became eligible for copyright protection for up to 75 years. Thus, despite the death of the creator, Walt Disney, in 1966, the copyright could still be exercised.</p>
<p>The next expiration date was in 2003. However, the 1998 &quot;Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act&quot; extended the copyright protection period even further. The maximum period was extended up to 120 years. At that time, under the US-Korea FTA agreement, the posthumous copyright recognition period was extended from 50 years to 70 years, and works whose copyrights had already expired were not affected.</p>
<p>However, the effect of the act was to extend the protection period for works still under copyright by 20 years. Therefore, Mickey Mouse&#39;s copyright protection period has been extended until 2023, and the copyright law is expected to expire in 2024.</p>
<h3><strong>&quot;Legally, this law is unconstitutional!&quot;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Is it real? No, it is not.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, many people have believed this from the beginning until now, but ultimately, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of the constitutionality of this law by a vote of 7-2. While it can be said that Mickey Mouse had a significant impact on U.S. copyright law, it is an unfounded claim.</p>
<p>Today, we talked about Mickey Mouse&#39;s copyright, and I&#39;m curious to see what changes will occur after the copyright expires in 2024!</p>
