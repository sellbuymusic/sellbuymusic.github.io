<p>Hello, this is SellBuyMusic!</p>
<p><img src="/images/2023-07-06-PlaylistKingdom/K-Drama Kingtheland.jpg" alt="[image1] Drama Kingdom Poster"></p>
<p>Do you know the JTBC drama "Kingdom"?</p>
<p>"Kingdom" is a drama starring Lee Jun-ho and Im Yoon-ah, and it is based on a webtoon serialized on Kakao.</p>
<p>It's a romance story about Cheon Sarang (Yoon-ah), an angelic hotelier at King Hotel, and Gu Won (Lee Jun-ho), who dislikes laughter. (The visual combination is amazing..ü§©)</p>
<p>Not only the love story of the main characters, but also the story of Sarang's close friends, Pyeonghwa and Daeul, is really interesting.</p>
<p>The drama also showcases the jobs of Sarang's friends, who work at a duty-free shop and as flight attendants, and it explores the hardships of service jobs. This is also part of the charm of the drama.</p>
<p>Today, SellBuyMusic has prepared a weekly playlist with the theme <strong>"Welcome to Kingdom üè®„Ö£Drama BGM"</strong>.</p>
<p>We have selected music that suits romantic dramas, youth dramas, New Age music, and OST-style songs.</p>
<p>Please listen to them all so that you can use the music for every important scene in the drama!</p>
