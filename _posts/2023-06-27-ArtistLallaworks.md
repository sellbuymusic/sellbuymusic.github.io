<p>Q1. Please introduce yourself. What genre of music do you mainly create?</p>
<p>A1. I&#39;m lallaworks, a composer who mainly creates BGM (background music). I had a turning point in my life five years ago due to health issues, which led me to start making music. In the early stages, I uploaded music to SELLBUYMUSIC.</p>
<p>Q2. How did you become familiar with SELLBUYMUSIC?</p>
<p>A2. I had experience creating YouTube videos, so I was aware of the existence of such platforms. While searching for ways to monetize my music, I came across a blog post about SELLBUYMUSIC and decided to check it out.</p>
<p>Q3. Do you have any artists or songs that inspire you?</p>
<p>A3. Even during a period of life when I was quite distant from music, I loved &quot;Joe Hisaishi - Merry-Go-Round of Life‚Äù, which resonated strongly with me compared to now. As a reference, I&#39;m constantly creating songs like &quot;Story: cinematic bgm&quot; and &quot;sad love: cinematic bgm&quot; among my own compositions.</p>

<p>Q4. What aspect do you pay the most attention to when creating music?</p>
<p>A4. I always strive to make it &quot;a little more innovative!&quot; Rapidly changing and vast, I believe that in order to grow, music representing such a world should be slightly more fresh.</p>
<p>Q5. If you have a favorite song among your creations, which one is it?</p>
<p>A5. I particularly like &quot;Space Exploration,&quot; and the cover art I drew for it. Most of all, this song holds a special place in my heart because it made me realize that I could share my music with others. It&#39;s a story of exploring the unknown world of the universe and overcoming challenges, which resonates with my own journey. Whenever I listen to it, I gain energy.</p>
<p>Q6. Please personally introduce the attractive points of your music to the readers.</p>
<p>A6. Diversity. It encompasses various genres and moods, and it will continue to expand in the future! üòä</p>
<p>Q7. Is there a moment in your daily life when you find musical inspiration?</p>
<p>A7. Every moment. I try to jot down ideas no matter what. It usually starts with contemplation, but the most focused moment is when I sit down to work. It&#39;s a very interesting time when all the gathered thoughts and ideas come to fruition.</p>
<p>Q8. What kind of artist would you like to be known as?</p>
<p>A8. I want to be known as an artist with anticipation. Someone who makes people curious about what kind of music they will create next and when they listen, they can&#39;t help but say, &quot;Ah, it&#39;s them again!&quot; I want to become a versatile artist.</p>
