<h3>Seoul, the heart of South Korea, has recently adopted a new slogan - "Seoul, My Soul". This change, based on a preference survey, signifies a vibrant shift from the previous slogan "I Seoul U", reflecting the city's dynamic spirit. In celebration of this transition, we present an eclectic indie and festival background music playlist that perfectly encapsulates the essence of Seoul, the city that fills the soul.</h3>

<p>Did you know that the slogan of Seoul, South Korea has changed? Through a preference survey, the slogan 'I Seoul U' that has been used since 2015 has been changed to 'Seoul, my soul'.</p>
<p>Preference surveys were conducted from December last year to January this year with the two candidates 'Seoul, my soul' and 'Seoul for you'. The first candidate, 'Seoul for you', is a slogan that represents the city's philosophy of being prepared for you. The second candidate, 'Seoul, my soul', takes advantage of the fact that the English word for soul and the pronunciation of Seoul are similar, meaning a city that can fill the soul. Both candidates have wonderful meanings, don't they?</p>

<p>On April 29th, Seoul City staged the confirmed slogan 'Seoul, my soul' at the end of the 2023 Han River Light Show (Drone Light Show) held at the Ttukseom Han River Park Waterfront Stage. It's really cool!</p>
