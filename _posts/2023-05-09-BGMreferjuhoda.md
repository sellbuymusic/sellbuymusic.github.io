    Naturally, various music is needed for daily life, travel, and food content. Sound effects are also often sought for fun. However, it is also true that it is difficult to spend a lot of money since the barriers to entry are not high. So, it seems that many people look for royalty-free music services that allow them to use diverse and high-quality music at a relatively low cost. The background music used in this video is also copyright-free music.

    The BGM used in this video is "Urban life style" by pianoman. As you can easily tell from the title of the song, it perfectly captures the lively and dynamic atmosphere of a city.
