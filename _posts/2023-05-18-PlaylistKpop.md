<h2>&quot;Self-Music Videos&quot; and Music- A Unique and Creative Way to Express Yourself!</h2>
<p>Hello, this is SellBuyMusic! The weather has become extremely hot from this week onwards! üåû</p>
<p><img src="/images/2023-05-18-PlaylistKpop/weather%20report%20about%20hot%20weather.png" alt="[image1] weather report about hot weather"></p>
<p>Yesterday, the daytime temperature rose up to a scorching 34 degrees. It&#39;s starting to feel like summer with the suffocating weather! üòÖ</p>
<p>Do you know about &#39;self-made music videos&#39;? Since 2-3 years ago, many celebrities have been producing self-made music videos, separate from conventional music videos, and uploading them on YouTube. One notable example is the YUA cover version of &#39;Eight - IU&#39; on the &#39;MemPD&#39; channel operated by Oh My Girl&#39;s Mimi!</p>

<p>These self-made music videos are composed, filmed, and edited by the artists themselves, and they are called &#39;self-made music videos&#39;. They have a more informal and freer vibe, which makes them unique. In addition, let me introduce the recent music video &#39;Fluffy Kitty&#39; by Lovelyz&#39;s Ryu Sujeong! It captures everyday life with pets... Isn&#39;t it fantastic?</p>

<p>These days, not only celebrities but also ordinary people are producing self-made music videos, capturing their daily lives and uploading them.</p>

<p>They created a self-made music video with the song &#39;Crush - Nappa&#39;! It&#39;s a refreshing and uplifting video ^^ As I mentioned earlier, more and more people are making self-made music videos as a way to record their daily lives or express their fandom! How about creating your own amazing self-made music video?! üòâ</p>
