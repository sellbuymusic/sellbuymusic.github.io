<p>There are various origins of Kiss Day. However, the most popular explanation is that it originated from a cute prank between a couple. When she asked, &quot;Are there any special days in June?&quot; he kissed her and jokingly said, &quot;Kiss Day.&quot;</p>
<p>Because of this romantic story, June 14th has become a day for lovers to confirm their feelings for each other through kisses. Isn&#39;t it romantic?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To commemorate this romantic day, we have prepared a weekly playlist:</p>
