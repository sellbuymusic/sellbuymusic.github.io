<h3>World Penguin Day is celebrated on April 25 and plays an important role in protecting penguins' natural habitats and maintaining their ecosystems. Through this day, we want to send a message that we should respect and protect the various life forms on our planet together.</h3>
<p>To commemorate this day, we would like to introduce a New Age BGM list that is perfect for cute pet videos. All of the music below was produced by Selby Music and will create a relaxing atmosphere with penguins.</p>
