    <p><strong>Q1. Please introduce yourself. What genre of music do you mainly make?</strong></p>
    <p>A1. Hello, I'm "Short ISFP," a composer and singer-songwriter. ðŸ˜Š
      At SELLBUYMUSIC, I mainly create cute background music or calm piano music. In addition, I release singles for my personal music activities and occasionally write music for dramas.</p>
   
<p><strong>Q2. How did you hear about SELLBUYMUSIC?</strong></p>
    <p>A2. It was a long time ago, so I don't remember well, but I think I found it through an internet search. I was thinking about how to earn additional income through something that I could do well, and that's how I found it. :)</p>
    <p><strong>Q3. If there is an artist or song that inspires you, who or what is it?</strong></p>
    <p>A3. Rather than being inspired by a particular song, I tend to remember music that I like or unique techniques, and try to apply them when I write songs later on. I guess this is what you would call inspiration..? ðŸ¥°
      I was influenced by pianist Yoon Ji-hee's performance and wrote a song called "The Season When You Bloom" (literal translation), and I also wrote a song called "Walking on the Road" under the influence of Kim Dong-ryul.

      These days, I listen to a lot of musical soundtracks. Recently, I'm hooked on "Six the Musical."</p>

    <p><strong>Q4. When making music, what do you focus on the most?</strong></p>
    <p>A4. I think I pay the most attention to the melody and atmosphere. Especially with BGMs, the mood and situation have to match well, so I tend to focus the most on whether the atmosphere fits well.
      Next, I pay attention to the length and structure of the song. If I keep the same atmosphere throughout the whole song, it can feel boring!</p>

		<p><strong>Q5. If you have a favorite song among your creations, what is it?</strong></p>
		<p>A5. It's too difficult to choose just one since all of my songs come from the heart, but if I had to pick one, I like "Fresh Spring" because it fits well with the current weather. Personally, I like the part where the piano comes in and it feels like taking a walk on a flower road :)</p>

		<p><strong>Q6. Can you introduce the charm points of your music to the readers?</strong></p>
		<p>A6. It's a bit embarrassing for me to say it myself, but I think it's the melody. ðŸ˜‰
		I'm not good at creating grandiose songs, but I'm confident in creating cute and lively songs that can be used for vlogs or pet YouTube videos.
		Also, I've been told that I have an advantage in writing lyrics that people can empathize with.
		I think my tendency to look at individual trees rather than the whole forest is reflected in my music.</p>
		<p><strong>Q7. Is there a moment in your daily life that inspires you musically?</strong>
  <p>A7. It's when I talk to people or when a particular sentence from a book or a movie resonates with me. I think about it and add my own story to it, and it becomes my song. </p>

		<p><strong>Q8. What kind of artist do you want to be known as in the world?</strong>
  <p>A8. I want to be remembered as an honest artist. I have a lot of lyrics that sing about warmth and hope, but I also want to express emotions like anger or frustration and connect with people who feel the same way.
  I want to be an artist who empathizes and communicates with others. :)</p>
