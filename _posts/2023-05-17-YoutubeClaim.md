<p><img src="/images/2023-05-17-YoutubeClaim/youtube%20claim.png" alt="[image1] Music copyright claim on YouTube"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. How many seconds of YouTube background music can trigger a copyright claim?</strong></p>
<p>A. Actually, there is no specific answer to this question. It can be triggered automatically after a certain number of seconds (there is no exact time threshold), or it can be triggered in just 1 second if the copyright owner reports it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. If I cover a song on an instrument and upload it to YouTube, is it also a copyright</strong> infringement? A. Yes, it is. There are three rights related to music: the right of the lyricist and composer, the neighboring rights of the performers, and the right of the record producer. To cover a song on YouTube, you need to obtain permission from all three parties, which is a difficult task in practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, the rights holders entrust their rights to a trust management organization: </p>
<p>✔️ Lyricists and composers - Korea Music Copyright Association, Music Copyright Association 
✔️ Performers (instrumentalists, singers) - Korea Music Performers&#39; Association 
✔️ Record producers - Korea Music Industry Association</p>

<p>If you want to use a movie clip, you must obtain permission from a trust management company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. Do movie reviewers on YouTube not have to worry about copyright?</strong> A. Famous YouTubers are affiliated with MCN companies that can solve copyright issues. However, even with white-listed subscribers or popular YouTuber agencies, to use content created by OTT service providers such as Netflix, you must obtain permission in advance. It is difficult to solve YouTube copyright infringement issues through cut editing. To use a part of a movie, it is safer to consult with the distributor in advance.</p>
<p>Today, we have answered some of the most frequently asked questions about copyright on YouTube. It is important to protect your precious videos by using copyrights properly and also to be aware of copyrights to support many copyright holders.</p>
