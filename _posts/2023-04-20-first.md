Let's take a look at some of them and see which ones are used in which videos.

The creator I'm going to introduce to you is “Guts King GMT" - which is "근성왕 겜마톡" in Korean. He's a South Korean gaming YouTube creator with 260,000 subscribers whose main content is Minecraft. He's especially known for large-scale structures that are only possible in the imagination. This time, he took on the challenge of building a “1 million cubic meter whale island in the wild.“
